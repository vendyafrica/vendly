# Vendly

## Core Idea

Vendly helps social sellers on Instagram and WhatsApp instantly turn their social media stores into real online stores. In minutes, sellers get a storefront, payments, delivery, and marketplace discovery.

## The Problem

### For Buyers

- Hard to find products consistently (algorithms hide posts in the social life, no central catalog).
- Purchase requires multiple DMs for price, availability, and delivery.
- Discovery is fragmented—you might see something once and never again.

### For Sellers

- Business runs in DMs → repetitive typing, manual confirmations.
- Catalog = scattered across posts/stories, no structured inventory.
- Payments are messy (screenshots, manual tracking).
- Delivery coordination eats time and leads to order drop-offs.

## The Solution

Vendly meets sellers where they are today.

- **AI-powered cataloging**: Import last ~20 IG posts or WhatsApp images → structured product listings.
- **Instant storefront**: 5-minute setup, amazing templates for your specific store, unique URL.
- **Built-in checkout**: Native M-Pesa + courier integration.
- **Order manager**: Dashboard + real-time notifications + tracking links.
- **Marketplace discovery**: Every product normalized into Vendly's taxonomy for search + exposure.

For buyers → trust, central discovery, fast checkout.  
For sellers → less admin, more completed orders, phone-first workflow.

## MVP Product Plan

- Auto-draft products from social media with help of AI.
- Storefront with a unique URL allowing further customization for your brand message.
- Payments: M-Pesa integration and bank integration.
- Delivery with a courier partner.
- Orders with a dashboard + real-time updates.
- Marketplace: Searchable listings from normalized taxonomy.

## Why Now

- **Behavioral**: Social-first commerce is the default for African micro-SMEs, but workflows are still manual.
- **Tech**: Modern vision/NLP makes auto-cataloging viable. PWAs deliver lightweight storefronts for low-data markets.
- **Ecosystem**: Mobile money + courier APIs are now reliable and widely available.

## Business Model

- Free storefront + marketplace listing.
- Pro subscription: Themes, analytics, custom domains, abandoned-cart links.
- Payments: Blended take on transactions.
- Logistics: Margin on courier + optional COD.
- Add-ons: Instant payouts, AI photo cleanup, fulfillment storage.

**In short: Vendly is your store beyond the feed.**
