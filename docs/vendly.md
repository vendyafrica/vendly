## Vision

Sellers just focus on their products and keeping customers happy.

## Target Users
- **Micro-business operators and solopreneurs**, especially young people whose businesses run manually — finding products, selling on social media platforms.  
- **Entrepreneurs specializing in high-frequency/niche products**: fashion, gifts, flowers, and everyday items that thrive in fast-moving, social contexts.  
- **Sellers who want the ease and discoverability of a proper store**, but not the pain of complex platforms or the limits of Jumia/Jiji.

## Market Problem
- Manual social selling is exhausting: sellers manage inventory over DMs, lose track of payments, and often miss deals due to chaotic communication.  
- Discoverability is low unless sellers pay for ads — most buyers never find what’s in the social feed.  
- Platforms like Shopify are too complex and lack local payment/delivery integrations.  
- Large marketplaces don’t support the nuanced, personal selling style of Africa’s new generation.
