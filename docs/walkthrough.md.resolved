# Visual Editing MVP Walkthrough

We have successfully implemented the MVP for visual editing in Sanity Studio! This guide explains the new workflow and how to verify the features.

## What Changed?
- **Unified Visual Editor**: The Sanity Studio now *only* shows the Presentation Tool (live preview), removing complex navigation menus.
- **Subdomain Routing**: Stores are previewed at `{store-slug}.localhost:3000`.
- **Inline Editing**: You can click directly on text in the preview to edit it.
- **Automated content**: New stores start with a pre-configured generic template (Header, Hero, Products, Offers, Footer).

## How to Test

### 1. Create a New Store
1. Go to the onboarding flow / sign up.
2. Enter your business details and create a store (e.g., named "My Cool Shop").
3. Upon completion, you will be automatically redirected to the **Visual Editor**.

### 2. Using the Visual Editor
1. You should land on `https://admin.localhost:3000/[store-slug]/studio`.
2. You will see the Admin Dashboard sidebar on the left, and the **Sanity Studio** in the main view.
3. The Studio will display a live preview of your store (iframe) on the right.

### 3. Verify Inline Editing
1. **Text**: Click on the "Welcome to My Cool Shop" heading in the Hero section.
2. The edit panel should appear (or a popover).
3. Change the text. The preview should update automatically (although for drafts, you might need to wait a second or see the "Draft" status).
4. **Images**: Click on the Hero background area. The configuration form will open where you can change the background image.

### 4. Verify Subdomain Access
1. Open a new tab and go to `http://[store-slug].localhost:3000`.
2. You should see the public version of your store.

## Technical Details
- **Middleware**: [apps/web/src/middleware.ts](file:///c:/Users/Jeremiah%20Sentomero/Desktop/vendly/apps/web/src/middleware.ts) handles the subdomain routing.
- **Draft Mode**: `apps/web/src/app/api/draft-mode` routes handle the secure preview connection.
- **Templates**: `packages/sanity/src/lib/createDefaultStoreContent.ts` seeds the initial data.
- **Components**: Generic `Header`, `Footer`, and `HeroSection` in `apps/web` are built to be reusable and editable.
